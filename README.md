# JavaBuilder2
Similar to JavaBuilder but its capable of doing subclass and it overrides the toString method.
run the program with a file in the command line that outlines the class you would like built. Attached is a file named "input.txt" that provides an example of the input. each class description should start with the class name followed by each variable on its own line int the format: AccessModifier Type Name. to make a subclass of the class above tab it one further than its parent class. the default override to the toString method is the class name, if you would like any of the variables to be in the override start its line with a dash as done in "input.txt. I wrote the program to check every aspect of the input, if you put too many tabs or newlines it will correct itself. if any fatal errors are present it will tell you where and exit.
